---

I believe in God, the Father almighty,  
Creator of heaven and earth,  
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,  

---

*(All bow for the following two lines)*:  
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary,  

---

suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died and was buried;  
he descended into hell;  

---

on the third day he rose again from the dead;  
he ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of God,  

---

the Father almighty;  
from there he will come to judge  
the living and the dead.  

---

I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of saints,  

---

the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and life everlasting. Amen.
