## Apostle’s Creed

I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth,  
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.  

*At the words that follow, up to and including ‘and became man’, all bow*  

Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary,  
suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died, and was buried;  
he descended into hell.  

On the third day, he rose again from the dead;  
he ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.  

From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. **Amen.**

Take my body, take my saving blood  
Gifts of bread and wine, Christ our Lord

As he promised while on earth  
I am with you for all time  
I am with you in this bread and wine
